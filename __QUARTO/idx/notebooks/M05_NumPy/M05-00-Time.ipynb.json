To get the mean runtime, you need to divide by the number of runs.\n\n`timeit()` works by evaluating code blocks written as strings.\n\nDefine code blocks to compare.\n\nPass code block strings to timeit functions.\n\nPrint the results\n\n## Using Magic \n\nInstead of calling `time` and `timeit` directly, we can use the  so-called magic commands.\n\nMagic commands are `%` or `%%` prefixed commands that work in Jupyter notebooks and other IPython environments.  \n\n`%` commands apply to **single lines**; they go at the beginning of the line.\n\n`%%` commands apply to **cell blocks**; they go at the top of the cell.\n\nMagic commands can take arguments. For more info, see \n* Chapter 3 in Wes McKinney's [_Python for Data Analysis_](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/python-for-data/9781449323592/ch03.html).\n* The [official documentation](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html)\n\n\nPlacing `%%timeit` or `%%time` at the top of a cell will appy these functions to the cell block.\n\nPlacing `%timeit` or `%time` as the first item on a line of code will apply the to a single line.\n\n\n**Types of Time**\n\n* **Wall clock time** measures how much time has passed, as if you were looking at the clock on your wall. \n* **CPU time** refers to how many seconds the CPU was actually busy.\n\nUsing **time** to compare loop and comprehension\n\nUsing **timeit** to compare loop and comprehension\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":false,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":true,"link-external-newwindow":true,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"number-sections":false,"output-file":"M05-00-Time.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.262","bibliography":["../../refs.bib"],"_quarto-vars":{"version":2,"course_num":"DS 5100","course_title":"Programming for Data Science","academic_term":"Fall 2023","cohort_type":"Online","course_code":"DS5100-2023-08-O","course_allocation":"msds_ds5100","canvas_url":"https://canvas.its.virginia.edu/courses/75059","github_url":"https://github.com/ontoligent/DS5100-2023-08-O","website_url":"https://ontoligent.github.io/DS5100-2023-08-O","survey_form_url":"https://forms.office.com/r/YWaFPXPKz8","request_form_url":"https://forms.office.com/r/7G65N5eppk"},"theme":"cosmo","fig-cap-location":"bottom","reader-mode":false},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
