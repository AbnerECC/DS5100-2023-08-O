They don't get a name.\n\nThe are \"anonymous.\"\n\nFrom Lutz 2019:\n\n>Besides the `def` statement, Python also provides an expression form that generates function objects. Because of its similarity to a tool in the Lisp language, itâ€™s called lambda. Like `def`, this expression creates a function to be called later, but it returns the function instead of assigning it to a name. This is why lambdas are sometimes known as anonymous (i.e., unnamed) functions. In practice, they are often used as a way to inline a function definition, or to defer execution of a piece of code.\n\n\nThe general form of a lambda function is:\n\nYou can call the function like this:\n\n**increment x**\n\n**sum two variables**\n\n## Assigned to a Variable\n\nEven though they don't get a name, they can be assigned to variables.\n\nHere, a lambda function gets assigned to `sum_two_vars`.\n\n**Check if a value is non-negative**\n\n**Package first element and all data into tuple**\n\n**Check for keyword \"dirty\"**  \n\n**pass *args for unspecified number of arguments**\n\n## Using Lambda\n\nLambda functions are often used in Pandas. We will discuss there use in more detail when we get to that topic.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":false,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":true,"link-external-newwindow":true,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"number-sections":false,"output-file":"M04-03-LambdaFunctions.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.262","bibliography":["../../refs.bib"],"_quarto-vars":{"version":2,"course_num":"DS 5100","course_title":"Programming for Data Science","academic_term":"Fall 2023","cohort_type":"Online","course_code":"DS5100-2023-08-O","course_allocation":"msds_ds5100","canvas_url":"https://canvas.its.virginia.edu/courses/75059","github_url":"https://github.com/ontoligent/DS5100-2023-08-O","website_url":"https://ontoligent.github.io/DS5100-2023-08-O","survey_form_url":"https://forms.office.com/r/YWaFPXPKz8","request_form_url":"https://forms.office.com/r/7G65N5eppk"},"theme":"cosmo","fig-cap-location":"bottom","reader-mode":false},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
