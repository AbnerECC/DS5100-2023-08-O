CPM.\n\n- It is a field with an established and large <strong>body of knowledge</strong> &ndash; PMBOK.</li>\n\nBroadly speaking, it refers to: \n\n- A class of rational **methods** and protocols for organizing the **labor** of **complex activities** in order to achieve **specific outcomes** on **time and on budget**.\n\nThink <strong>NASA's</strong> space program in the 1960s.\n\nIts history dates to the early 20th century but becomes highly developed in the 1950s and 60s.\n\n- It is closely associated with <strong>US military</strong> operations, e.g. [Gantt Charts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart) and [PERT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_evaluation_and_review_technique).\n\n- It was later adapted to <strong>software development</strong>, due to the complexity and importances of of this kind of work.\n\n![](../media/early-gantt-chart.png)\n\n[Source](https://www.onepager.com/community/blog/a-brief-history-of-the-gantt-chart/)\n\n<p>Software is also <strong>mission critical</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>From the beginning, it has been used to support <strong>critical operations</strong>: weapons systems, air traffic control, financial systems, health care, etc.</li>\n<li>Only recently are we seeing the effects of software design &ndash; in the form of data products &ndash; fail on the basis of bias and other flaws that lead to <strong>social harm</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>In the 1960s</strong>, the US Department of Defenses study of software problems found that:</p>\n<ul class=\"uva-lessons-ul\">\n<li>47% of software delivered could not be used, as it usually didn&rsquo;t meet requirements</li>\n<li>29% of funded software was never delivered, as it was usually canceled due to cost/schedule overruns</li>\n<li>19% of software was useful after extensive rework, and it usually cost 36 times more to fix problems after release</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Because of this, <strong>software engineering was developed.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>But Software development is hard</strong> for many reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hardware and software are inherently <strong>complex</strong>.</li>\n<li>Code is imperfect and <strong>error-prone</strong>.</li>\n<li>Code is always <strong>an interpretation of specifications</strong> that are always <strong>underspecified</strong>. &rarr; [DEBUGGING THE SPEC](http://johnunsworth.name/KR/halsted.html)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Underspecified</strong> in two senses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The inherent <strong>inadequacy of language</strong> to represent reality.\n<ul>\n<li>\"The map is not the terrain\"</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The fact that <strong>people don't know what they want</strong> even when they say they do.\n<ul>\n<li>That is, reality itself changes.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n----\n\nThe slipperiness of writing code that achieves our goals is **the subject of humor**:\n\n![](../media/pm-operation-success.jpg)\n\n[Source](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/411446115951363129/)\n\n----\n\n<p>Many <strong>paradigms of the software development</strong> <strong>life cycle</strong> (SDLC) have been introduced over the years to address these issues:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Waterfall</li>\n<li>Spiral</li>\n<li>Etc. &rarr;
