{"title":"Refreshing the Course Repo","markdown":{"headingText":"Refreshing the Course Repo","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nEach day you will want to update the forked version of the course repo you created for your homework in Module 01.\n\nHere are the steps to do that: \n\n**First**, if you have made any changes to the course notebooks and want to keep your changes, make copies of these files in your private repo. \n\n**Second**, enter the command `git stash` within your local repo to hide the changes you've made to the current branch. To learn more about how to use `stash`, check out the [docs on GitHub](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-stash). For now, we are just using it clean up the repo so when you pull, you don't run into a conflict between local and remote changes.\n\n**Third**, go to the forked version of the course repo on GitHub and issue a Sync Fork command to refresh the content of your repo with the new course content. The screenshot below shows where this command is located on your repo's web page:\n\n![](../media/sync-fork-page.png)\n\n**Fourth**, go back to your local repo and run `git pull`. You should now have the most recent content from the course repo."},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":true,"link-external-newwindow":true,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"number-sections":false,"output-file":"refreshing-the-course-repo.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.262","bibliography":["../refs.bib"],"_quarto-vars":{"version":2,"course_num":"DS 5100","course_title":"Programming for Data Science","academic_term":"Fall 2023","cohort_type":"Online","course_code":"DS5100-2023-08-O","course_allocation":"msds_ds5100","canvas_url":"https://canvas.its.virginia.edu/courses/75059","github_url":"https://github.com/ontoligent/DS5100-2023-08-O","website_url":"https://ontoligent.github.io/DS5100-2023-08-O","survey_form_url":"https://forms.office.com/r/YWaFPXPKz8","request_form_url":"https://forms.office.com/r/7G65N5eppk"},"theme":"cosmo","fig-cap-location":"bottom","reader-mode":false},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
