Customer satisfaction by **early and continuous delivery** of valuable software. &rarr; The \"early and often\" of open source development.\n\n2. **Welcome changing requirements**, even in **late** development.\n\n3. Deliver working software **frequently** (weeks rather than months).\n\n4. Close, **daily** cooperation between business people and developers.\n\n5. Projects are built around **motivated individuals**, who should be **trusted**.\n\n6. **Face-to-face** conversation is the best form of communication (co-location).\n\n7. **Working software** is the primary measure of progress.\n\n8. **Sustainable** development, able to maintain a constant pace.\n\n9. **Continuous** attention to technical excellence and good design.\n\n10. **Simplicity**&mdash;the art of maximizing the amount of work not done&mdash;is essential.\n\n11. Best [architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_Architecture), requirements, and designs emerge from **self-organizing** teams.\n\n12. Regularly, **the team reflects** on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly.\n\nAs you can see, it's all about **giving teams the freedom and trust** to creatively respond to client needs and change.\n\n## Aside\n\nAs an aside, it's worth noting the effect of the Web on these developments.\n\n- Agile was spurred by the **affordances of the Web** and **open source software**\n- And for teams to **organize organically**,&nbsp;without the oversight of governmental bodies or corporations\n- Influenced by the success of Open Source tools like **Linux**\n- Consistent with **Git** as a tool for organically organizing software development."},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":true,"link-external-newwindow":true,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"number-sections":false,"output-file":"agile-dev.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.262","bibliography":["../refs.bib"],"_quarto-vars":{"version":2,"course_num":"DS 5100","course_title":"Programming for Data Science","academic_term":"Fall 2023","cohort_type":"Online","course_code":"DS5100-2023-08-O","course_allocation":"msds_ds5100","canvas_url":"https://canvas.its.virginia.edu/courses/75059","github_url":"https://github.com/ontoligent/DS5100-2023-08-O","website_url":"https://ontoligent.github.io/DS5100-2023-08-O","survey_form_url":"https://forms.office.com/r/YWaFPXPKz8","request_form_url":"https://forms.office.com/r/7G65N5eppk"},"theme":"cosmo","fig-cap-location":"bottom","reader-mode":false},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
