I will, in fact, claim that the difference between a bad programmer and a good one is whether he considers his \\[sic] code or his data structures more important. Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships.\n\nWhich sounds a lot like [Eric Raymond’s “Rule of Representation” from 2003](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html):\n\n> Fold knowledge into data, so program logic can be stupid and robust.\n\nWhich was just his summary of ideas like [this one from Rob Pike in 1989](http://doc.cat-v.org/bell_labs/pikestyle):\n\n> Data dominates. If you’ve chosen the right data structures and organized things well, the algorithms will almost always be self-evident. Data structures, not algorithms, are central to programming.\n\nWhich cites [Fred Brooks from 1975](https://archive.org/stream/mythicalmanmonth00fred/mythicalmanmonth00fred_djvu.txt):\n\n> **Representation is the Essence of Programming**\\\n\\\nBeyond craftsmanship lies invention, and it is here that lean, spare, fast programs are born. Almost always these are the result of strategic breakthrough rather than tactical cleverness. Sometimes the strategic breakthrough will be a new algorithm, such as the Cooley-Tukey Fast Fourier Transform or the substitution of an n log n sort for an n 2 set of comparisons.\n\n> **Much more often, strategic breakthrough will come from redoing the representation of the data or tables.** This is where the heart of your program lies. Show me your flowcharts and conceal your tables, and I shall be continued to be mystified. Show me your tables, and I won’t usually need your flowcharts; they’ll be obvious.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nSee [video](https://canvas.its.virginia.edu/courses/75059/modules/items/821906) on Canvas.\n:::"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":true,"link-external-newwindow":true,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"number-sections":false,"output-file":"on-data.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.262","bibliography":["../refs.bib"],"_quarto-vars":{"version":2,"course_num":"DS 5100","course_title":"Programming for Data Science","academic_term":"Fall 2023","cohort_type":"Online","course_code":"DS5100-2023-08-O","course_allocation":"msds_ds5100","canvas_url":"https://canvas.its.virginia.edu/courses/75059","github_url":"https://github.com/ontoligent/DS5100-2023-08-O","website_url":"https://ontoligent.github.io/DS5100-2023-08-O","survey_form_url":"https://forms.office.com/r/YWaFPXPKz8","request_form_url":"https://forms.office.com/r/7G65N5eppk"},"theme":"cosmo","fig-cap-location":"bottom","reader-mode":false},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
