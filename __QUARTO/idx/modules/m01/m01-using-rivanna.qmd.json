Many cloud resources use Linux.\n\nUnderstanding how to do work from the command line on such systems is an essential skill of the data scientist.\n\nIf you have never used the command line, have no fear! Just enter the commands exactly as shown and ask questions in the Teams chat if you are stuck.\n\n**Now, create a directory for your course and this course by entering the following commands:**\n\n```         \ncd Documents \nmdkir MSDS \ncd MSDS \nmkdir DS5100 \ncd DS5100\n```\n\nIf the `Documents` directory does not exist, create that first using the mkdir command.\n\n-   `cd` means \"change directory,\" and is a basic Unix command.\n-   `mkdir` means \"make directory.\" It's also a basic Unix command.\n\nNote that you can use the tab key to complete path and command names as you type.\n\nYou don't have to, but it would be a good idea to create subdirectories for any of your courses that use Rivanna.\n\nMore information about Unix shell commands can be found the document [Unix Shell Commands](../../topics/unix.qmd).\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":true,"link-external-newwindow":true,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"number-sections":false,"output-file":"m01-using-rivanna.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.262","bibliography":["../../refs.bib"],"_quarto-vars":{"version":2,"course_num":"DS 5100","course_title":"Programming for Data Science","academic_term":"Fall 2023","cohort_type":"Online","course_code":"DS5100-2023-08-O","course_allocation":"msds_ds5100","canvas_url":"https://canvas.its.virginia.edu/courses/75059","github_url":"https://github.com/ontoligent/DS5100-2023-08-O","website_url":"https://ontoligent.github.io/DS5100-2023-08-O","survey_form_url":"https://forms.office.com/r/YWaFPXPKz8","request_form_url":"https://forms.office.com/r/7G65N5eppk"},"theme":"cosmo","fig-cap-location":"bottom","reader-mode":false},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
