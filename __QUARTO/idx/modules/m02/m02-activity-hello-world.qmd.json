For example:\n\n![](../../media/which-python.png)\n\nIf you do not see \"anaconda\" in that path, then run the following command:\n\n```bash\nmodule load anaconda\n```\n\nThis will update your environment to use Anaconda's distribution of Python. \n\nAfter running the command, enter the command to see which pythion is being used to confirm that it is the one from Ancaconda.\n\n## Aside\n\nNote that you can use `module` to run other programs on your Rivanna account. \n\nType `module list` to see which programs have already been installed on your account.\n\nType `module spider` to see all the programs you can install.\n\n## The Python Interactive Shell\n\nFrom the command line, enter python \n\nYou should get the Python Shell:\n\n![](../../media/python-prompt.png)\n\nThis is also called the Python standard REPL, which stands for \"Read-Eval-Print Loop\".\n\nMake sure you see that you are using version 3 of Python.\n\nIf you see Python 2, exit the shell by entering `quit()` and try again by entering python3 at the command line.\n\nAt the `>>>` prompt type `print(\"Hello, World!\")` and press return.\n\nIf you've never used Python, you've just completed an important ritual. If you have used Python, well, you did it again :-) \n\n## Try `this`\n\nNow, enter following line at the prompt and press return:\n\n```python\nimport this\n```\n\nWhat do you see?\n\nTo exit the Python Shell, enter `quit()`  or `exit()` and hit return.\n\n## Running Python Files\n\nNow create a file called `hello.py` using the command line editor `nano`. Enter the same commands you used above.\n\nThen run it from the command line by directly invoking the Python interpreter python.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nSee [video](https://343772-1.kaf.kaltura.com/media/M02%20Activity%3A%20Hello%2C%20World!/1_mk92k4i5) in Canvas.\n:::"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":true,"link-external-newwindow":true,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"number-sections":false,"output-file":"m02-activity-hello-world.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.262","bibliography":["../../refs.bib"],"_quarto-vars":{"version":2,"course_num":"DS 5100","course_title":"Programming for Data Science","academic_term":"Fall 2023","cohort_type":"Online","course_code":"DS5100-2023-08-O","course_allocation":"msds_ds5100","canvas_url":"https://canvas.its.virginia.edu/courses/75059","github_url":"https://github.com/ontoligent/DS5100-2023-08-O","website_url":"https://ontoligent.github.io/DS5100-2023-08-O","survey_form_url":"https://forms.office.com/r/YWaFPXPKz8","request_form_url":"https://forms.office.com/r/7G65N5eppk"},"theme":"cosmo","fig-cap-location":"bottom","reader-mode":false},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
