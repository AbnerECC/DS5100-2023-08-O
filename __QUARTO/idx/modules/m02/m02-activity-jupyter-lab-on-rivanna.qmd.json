As a reminder, the URL is [https://rivanna-portal.hpc.virginia.edu/](https://rivanna-portal.hpc.virginia.edu/).\n\nFrom the Interactive Apps menu, select JupyterLab and fill out the form to initiate a new session. Your form should have the following values:\n\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid gray;\">\n![](../../media/jupyter-on-rivanna-form.png)\n</div>\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\nNote that you may increase the number of hours, cores, and megabytes of RAM, but asking for too much will increase the time it takes to start your session. So select just the resources needed and enter our course allocation `{{< var course_allocation >}}` if this value is different than in the image above).\n:::\n\nOnce the session is ready, launch the notebook.\n\nOnce you are in the notebook, use file system tab on the left to get to the directory of your personal assessments repo. Remember, you created two repos for this class &mdash; one for course content from the instructor, and one for your own course work. Use the latter for this exercise. \n\nIn a code cell in the notebook, enter the code to print `\"Hello, World!\"`, and run the cell.\n\nSave your notebook as `hello-world.ipynb`."},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":true,"link-external-newwindow":true,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"number-sections":false,"output-file":"m02-activity-jupyter-lab-on-rivanna.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.262","bibliography":["../../refs.bib"],"_quarto-vars":{"version":2,"course_num":"DS 5100","course_title":"Programming for Data Science","academic_term":"Fall 2023","cohort_type":"Online","course_code":"DS5100-2023-08-O","course_allocation":"msds_ds5100","canvas_url":"https://canvas.its.virginia.edu/courses/75059","github_url":"https://github.com/ontoligent/DS5100-2023-08-O","website_url":"https://ontoligent.github.io/DS5100-2023-08-O","survey_form_url":"https://forms.office.com/r/YWaFPXPKz8","request_form_url":"https://forms.office.com/r/7G65N5eppk"},"theme":"cosmo","fig-cap-location":"bottom","reader-mode":false},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
